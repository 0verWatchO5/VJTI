APPROACH:
1. Disassembled the program
Loaded the .exe file into Binary Ninja to view its assembly code.

2. Switched to Graph Mode
Changed the display to graph mode to see how the program's logic flows between different code blocks.

3. Analyzed the logic
Focused on the code handling Lock() and Unlock() logic.
Found a JNE (Jump if Not Equal) instruction, which checked if the input was correct. If not, it led to the "WRONG" message.

4. Modified the behavior
Changed JNE to JE (Jump if Equal), reversing the condition.
This made the program treat a wrong input as correct and bypass the "WRONG" logic.

5. Executed the patched file
Ran the modified .exe.
Instead of showing "WRONG," the program revealed the flag: "I right the wrongs."
