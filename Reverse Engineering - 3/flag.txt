T915{I_L0V3_X0R_3NCRYP710N}

Approach:
1. The file was executed in Linux terminal, using wine.
2. As all the previous files had their flags starting from "T915{", I was sure that this one will be the same.
3. After executing the program in wine, I entered "T915{" which showed it was wrong, 
   I got the hint that the index value 5 was wrong as it was blank. It showed binary values up to where it was correct.
4. The values matched "T915{" in ascii characters. 
5. Then I went back to the main function in ghidra where the logic was decompiled, and took the values which were stored from local_24 to local_a3[0].
6. I had noticed the binary values were performing a bitwise XOR operation with each other to generate an ascii character.
7. After taking the values stored between local_24 to local_a3[0] I performed a bitwise XOR with each other by making a password solving script in python.

Providing the code below:

def solve_password():
    # Values from the binary
    local_24 = [0x39, 0x4d, 0x4a, 0x45, 0x68,0x2f,0x27,0x35,0x4c,0x38,0x49,0x44,0x59,0x56,0x31,0x5b,0x60,0x32,0x68,0x4e,0x57,0x34,0x4a,0x61,0x53,0x69,0x43,0] 
    local_3f = [0x6d, 0x74, 0x7b, 0x70, 0x13,0x66,0x78,0x79,0x7c,0x6e,0x7a,0x1b,1, 0x66,99,4,0x53,0x7c,0x2b,0x1c,0xe,100,0x7d,0x50,99,0x27,0x3e]  
    #Total 27 characters in password.
    
    # Calculate characters of password
    password = ""
    for i in range(min(len(local_24), len(local_3f))):
        char = local_24[i] ^ local_3f[i]
        password += chr(char)
        print(f"Position {i}: {local_24[i]:02x} ^ {local_3f[i]:02x} = {char:02x} ('{chr(char)}')")
    
    return password

print("Calculating password characters...")
password = solve_password()
print(f"\nCharacters of password: {password}") 

Output:
